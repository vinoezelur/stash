sometime back when i was idling away with my friend n ogling babes at a mall, he said something to the tune of "just because you don't eat a lion, doesn't necessarily mean the lion won't eat you". And that made total sense. 

Well, it is what it is!

Though in hindsight, he shouldn't have eaten my muffin. i lost a friend that day.
