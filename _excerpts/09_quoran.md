I found this gem when I was scrolling furiously on quora. Totally forgot the original question. Nor do I remember the actual answer. This was a comment under an answer.

Sometime back when i was strolling in a mall with a friend discussing about Indian GDP and the soon to be correction in the Stock market (Yeah, we both were just ogling babes, n eating muffins). He said something similar to the above quote. something profound. something to the tune of "just because you don't eat a lion, doesn't necessarily mean the lion won't eat you". And that made total sense. 

Well, it is what it is!

Though in hindsight, he shouldn't have eaten my muffin. I lost a friend that day.
