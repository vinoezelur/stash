    You may not be her first, her last, or her only. <br />
    She loved before she may love again. <br />
    But if she loves you now, what else matters? <br />
    She’s not perfect—you aren’t either, <br />
    and the two of you may never be perfect together <br />
    but if she can make you laugh, <br />
    cause you to think twice, <br />
    and admit to being human and making mistakes, <br />
    hold onto her and give her the most you can. <br />
    She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, <br />
    but she will give you a part of her <br />
    that she knows you can break—her heart. <br />
    So don’t hurt her, don’t change her, don’t analyze <br />
    and don’t expect more than she can give. <br />
    Smile when she makes you happy, <br />
    let her know when she makes you mad, <br />
    and miss her when she’s not there.
