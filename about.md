<h1>Raison d’être </h1>
<p>(Coz a French title seemed cool)</p>
The search for purpose n meaning in my life began a solid 27 minutes earlier. Pondering on such absurdities had always been my boon and bane. The technical term is ‘daydreaming’, medical term is ‘overthinking’. <em>Po-tay-to po-tah-to! </em>Well, it had cost me quite dearly in the past. Nonetheless, here we are. Digressing in to trivialities is yet another significant bane.

The reluctance to write or open a blog earlier, to my knowledge, might have stemmed from the following reasons<a href="#abt_footnote"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. 
<ol type="a">
    <li><code>sharing is caring -</code> As a selfish introvert, I had neither shared nor cared, which is a plausible explanation. Additionally, most of my time is spent on mindlessly scrolling reddit while dwelling/dreaming on/about the past/future. ref c for more details. </li>
    <li><code>feedback and comments -</code> constructive feedback is always good, at least thats what I keep telling myself. But my hyper-inflated ego didn’t mature past 3rd grade B section. So it cringes on any kind of feedback, positive or negative. During those moments, I can relate to how slugs feel about salt at a cellular level. However the lack of comment section here, is actually because of ref c. </li>
    <li><code>sheer laziness, lackadaisical attitude and lethargy </code></li>
</ol>
<h3>So why now?</h3>
Purpose, as I must say, of this writing, is just to spew out my internal monologues. Hence, the question of how it would benefit you as a reader, is practically beyond me. I tend to have long monologues (as like now). Hence, I asserted, that I should just jot them all somewhere and when I or someone else read it later, a door of light may open. Sometimes its just a drunk driver with super-blinding headlights at the end of the tunnel, I must warn.
<h3>So what now?</h3>
Honestly, am clueless as ever n everyone. For now, I could think of some here. Prefix every point with “Rant on “.
<ol>
    <li>spirituality, religion, unicorns and cockroaches, </li>
    <li>principles of design, </li>
    <li>love, kajakaja<a href="#abt_footnote"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and heart-breaks, </li>
    <li>movies, songs and games, </li>
    <li>gadgets, </li>
    <li>beauty of javascript, </li>
    <li>philosophy, </li>
    <li>economics, </li>
    <li>l’euthanasie, and sometimes puzzles, </li>
</ol>
&mdash; with generous dose of blatant hypocrisies, grammatical errors, pseudoscience and logical fallacies. Typically, everything you'd find in a loving family whatsapp group.
<br />All the categories on the left, will revolve around these.
<h3>Who cares!</h3>
They say nothing bonds people together like shared mutual hatred. For the sake of inclusivity, I have tried to offend people of all races, religions, colours, genders, ethnicities and physical abilities. So, in case you find that I have not offended enough (is under-offended a word?), the sub-set of people or ideas that you hate, please bear with me and subscribe<a href="#abt_footnote"><sup>[3]</sup></a> for updates.

<br />
That said, ride on…

        [1] Honestly, it’s just 1 reason - ref c. However, everything exudes a sense of purpose when presented as meticulously numbered bullet points. <br />
        [2] Technical terms are sex, matter, gilma. Medical term is coitus. <br />
        [3] Subscribing feature was too cumbersome to code. So please check this space after a few weeks yourselves. May the force be with you!
