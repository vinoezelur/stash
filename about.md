<h1>Raison d’être </h1>
<p>(Coz a French title seemed cool)</p>
The search for purpose n meaning in my life began a solid 27 minutes earlier. Pondering on such absurdities had always been my boon and bane. Colloquially ‘daydreaming’, medical term is ‘overthinking’. <em>Po-tay-to po-tah-to! </em> 

The reluctance to write or open a blog earlier, to my knowledge, might have stemmed from the following reasons<a href="#abt_footnote"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. 
<ol type="a">
    <li><code>sharing is caring &mdash;</code> As a selfish introvert, I had neither shared nor cared, which is a plausible explanation. Additionally, most of my time is spent on mindlessly scrolling reddit/insta. During other times ref c  </li>
    <li><code>feedback and comments -</code> constructive feedback is always good, at least thats what I keep telling myself. But my hyper-inflated ego didn’t mature past 3rd grade B section. So it cringes on any kind of feedback, positive or negative. Exactly, how salt works on slugs. (no, not a recipe.. empathise here). </li>
    <li><code>sheer laziness, lackadaisical attitude and lethargy </code></li>
</ol>
<h3>The why</h3>
Purpose, as I must say, of this writing, is just to spew out my internal monologues. Hence, the question of how it would benefit you as a reader, is practically beyond me. I tend to have long monologues (as like now). Hence, I asserted, that I should just jot them all somewhere and when I or someone else read it later, a door of light may open. Sometimes its just a drunk driver with super-blinding headlights at the end of the tunnel, I must warn.
<h3>The what</h3>
Honestly, am clueless as ever n everyone. For now, I could think of some here. Prefix every point with “Rant on “.
<ol>
    <li>spirituality, religion, unicorns and cockroaches, </li>
    <li>design - the beauty and the lack of, </li>
    <li>love, kajakaja<a href="#abt_footnote"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and heart-breaks, </li>
    <li>movies, songs and games, sometimes books </li>
    <li>gadgets, </li>
    <li>philosophy, </li>
    <li>economics, </li>
    <li>l’euthanasie, and sometimes puzzles, </li>
</ol>
&mdash; with generous servings of blatant hypocrisies, grammatical errors, pseudoscience and logical fallacies. Typically, everything you'd find in a loving family whatsapp group.
<br />All the categories on the left, will revolve around these.
<h3>The who</h3>
They say nothing bonds people together like shared mutual hatred. For the sake of inclusivity, I have tried to offend people of all races, religions, colours, genders, ethnicities, sexual orientations and physical abilities. So, in case you find that I have not offended enough (is under-offended a word?), the sub-set of people or ideas that you hate, please bear with me and subscribe<a href="#abt_footnote"><sup>[3]</sup></a> for updates.

That said, ride on…

        [1] Honestly, it’s just 1 reason - ref c. However, everything exudes a sense of purpose when presented as meticulously numbered bullet points. <br />
        [2] Technical terms are sex, matter, gilma<sup>[2]</sup>. Medical term is coitus. <br />
        [3] Was too lazy to add Subscribing or commenting feature. So please check this space after a few weeks yourselves. May the force be with you!
